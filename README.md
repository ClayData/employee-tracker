# employee-tracker
CLI that uses MySql and Inquirer to track employees. The SQL database contains 3 different tables, one for employees, roles and departments. The employee tabke relates to the role table with the role_id. Department_id is used in the role table to relate to the department table. The CLI uses inquirer prompts to ask the user how they would like to interact with the database. Different answers cause different SQL querys to occur and those querys return different tables containing the information asked for. The user may also add to and delete in the different tables.
